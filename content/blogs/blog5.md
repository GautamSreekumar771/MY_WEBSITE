When I received my acceptance letter from LBS in 2020, I was beyond ecstatic. But the icing on the cake was when LBS offered me a scholarship. I never considered myself 'scholarly', only enthusiastic, eager, and entrepreneurial. How could this be I wondered, especially when I came to campus. Everyone was accomplished, hardworking, and, above all, erudite. 

Nevertheless, the first few weeks were the best: A lot of drinks and engaging conversations with LBS's diverse cohort. I fondly remember when I first visited Sammy Ofer and was struck by its magnanimity. Those were happy days though, the month of October (my Birthday month!) has been brutal. Between organizing the largest student-run LGBT+ conference in EUROPE and executing R codes, it's been challenging to say the least. 

Nevertheless, I am aware that time goes fast, and I am going to miss every second of LBS and the 'b-school' experience a year later. Until then, I am looking forward to more British pubs, exams, and finance!
