title: Charlie, my pet dog's story.
---

Rummaging through muddy backwaters as the monsoons begin gaining steam in Kerala, India, Charlie charged at me with a centripetal force that restricted his sprint to circular motions â€” not because of his mental prowess, but because of his inability to see and dented cerebral cortex. Charlie, my first pet dog, wasn't born with disabilities, but was, rather, a victim of lacklustre Indian roads replete with potholes as a stray. Like many strays in India, Charlie's life before rescue is unknown. As a family, all we know of is his ebullient countenance, his discernible bark, and his fondness for fruits. 

When he first came to our cloistered two-bedroom apartment in the city, the commotion between my sister and I was uncheckered, to say the least: How could two novices train a dog with disabilities? Could we recuperate his eyes? Should he not be raised on a farm? Veritable, though pertinent, questions exacerbated the already tense environment of our abode. But our impasse ended when any talk of giving him away arose: We knew we needed him as much as he needed us. 

So, to begin with raising him in a disability-friendly space, we shifted to a home within the city with a balcony, got him dog diapers, took him for timed walks, hired a trainer, and bought litter mats. All the effort was in vain. If two trainers with a combined experience of 20 years couldn't apprehend his psyche, our prayers for a 'trained pet' seemed unattainable. Nevertheless, we did not relent; and continued to hope with whatever patience we had left. 

The surprising, albeit treacherous, event came in the form of a pandemic: India's 2nd and more lethal wave of COVID-19. Life took a 180-degree turn and compelled my sister and Charlie to move back to our village, where space was never a concern. Here, Charlie has a doghouse the size of an apartment, acres and acres of lush, verdant space, and freedom from mundane training sessions. Ecstatic would be an understatement; in this quaint shire of fewer than 25,000 townsfolk, his freedom to litter, dash, and bark is unfettered. As is with all serendipitous circumstances that come to a grinding halt, Charlie will have to go back to the city one day. But for now, he's a happy pup.
