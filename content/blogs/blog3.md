title: Living in India's only Communist State,Kerala
---

Nestled in the quaint hinterlands of the southernmost tip of India, Kerala is one of the twenty-eight states that cover the expanse of the South Asian subcontinent, also known colloquially as Bharatvarsha. Known for its sweltering summers and bucolic scenery, the State has been home to my forebears for over 100 years. Despite the vicarious love for my origins, I was never fortunate enough to reside in my hometown, Kidangoor, for an extended period — that was until the second wave of COVID derailed all my plans and forced me to reside in this hamlet for over three months and counting.

In my short time here, this town with less than 25,000 townsfolk left an indelible mark on me. Everything seemed perfect, yet as a city dweller my whole life, I was raised to disparage those who used crude means to cook and live. But that isn't all; Kerala, as a State in the Union, went above and beyond my expectation. Everyone in my neighbourhood owned homes and multiple vehicles, roads had no potholes, the supply of electricity was constant, and, above all, the State's healthcare infrastructure was immaculate  — thus, preparing it for the second tsunami of COVID-19 in India. Could this really be a Communist State run by Marxists? 

And to that question, yes, Kerala is presently the only Communist State in India. I pondered, " What about the barnacles of Maoism that restricts the rights of individuals? " An expectation of Communism predicated on an outlook of overarching government control, a secular police force impugning on the right to practice one's religion, and communists enforcing Karl Marx's vacuous doctrines. Much to my delight and in stark contrast to the fodder I was fed, that wasn't to be. 

Needless to say, Kerala wouldn't pass the communism purity test as envisioned by Karl Marx; however, there's something different going on here. A State that delivers equal access to health care and education, that isn't mired in corruption scandals now and then, that values the rights of its citizenry  —  an aberration from the Indian norm, where institutional corruption controls every aspect of one's life. It goes without saying that I will never subscribe to Communism and fall on the centre-right spectrum of almost all economic and social issues; nevertheless, Kerala is unique and worth studying, despite my ideological moorings.
